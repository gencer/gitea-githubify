# gitea-githubify
GitHub Theme for Gitea (and for Gogs)

This repo contains patch files for Gitea to make Gitea looks like GitHub.

~~**Note** **that**, patch size is huge, because it still needs many fixes. Until it fixed and proper version released, I will decrease patch size.~~

I minified and decreased patch size. I will try to implement more minified version later.

Install
==

Upload **patch.css** and **patch-ext.css** files to **public** dir.

Open **gogs.css** for Gogs or **index.css** for Gitea. Put this two lines at to **top**:

    @import url("patch.css");
    @import url("patch-ext.css");
    
Save and close. Thats all. Do not forget to clear browser cache. (__or CTRL+F5__)

Extra patch:
===
Extra patch files is required for customized view. If you only upload patch.css file, it won't look better.
